    <!-- Insurance Coverage -->
    <div class="faq-section">
      <h2>Do you accept insurance?</h2>
      <p>Child Neuropsychology of Houston does not accept insurance payments for testing. We will, however, provide documents for you to file with your insurance carrier. Parents should not expect any reimbursement for the cost of the evaluation.</p>
      <p>To schedule an appointment for testing, a deposit of $300 will be collected. This deposit will be applied to the final cost of the evaluation. The deposit is non-refundable.</p>
    </div>
    
    <!-- Testing Process -->
    <div class="faq-section">
      <h2>Who will be with my child during testing?</h2>
      <p>All testing is conducted directly by either Dr. Prasad or Dr. Kerne. We do not use technicians or trainees for any portion of the evaluation.</p>
    </div>
    
    <!-- Testing Duration -->
    <div class="faq-section">
      <h2>Is testing conducted in one day?</h2>
      <p>Our goal is to complete testing on one day to best assess your child's cognitive stamina. However, in some cases, testing must be completed over two days depending on your child's needs and attention span.</p>
    </div>
    
    <!-- Testing Length -->
    <div class="faq-section">
      <h2>How long does testing take?</h2>
      <p>The length of testing varies by the age of the child and their specific needs:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Young children</strong> (under age 7): Typically 3-4 hours with frequent breaks</li>
        <li><strong>School-age children</strong> (7-12 years): Typically 4-6 hours</li>
        <li><strong>Teens</strong> (13+ years): Typically 6-8 hours</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We schedule breaks throughout the day and a lunch break for longer evaluations.</p>
    </div>
    
    <!-- Parent Presence -->
    <div class="faq-section">
      <h2>Do parents need to stay during the testing session?</h2>
      <p>For children under the age of 9 years, we ask that parents remain in the waiting room. Young children often need breaks and checking in with their parents during breaks provides reassurance.</p>
      <p>For older children, parents may leave but should remain available by phone and return at the scheduled pickup time.</p>
    </div>
    
    <!-- What to Bring -->
    <div class="faq-section">
      <h2>What should my child bring to the evaluation?</h2>
      <p>We recommend bringing:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Water bottle</li>
        <li>Healthy snacks</li>
        <li>Lunch (for full-day evaluations)</li>
        <li>Any current eyeglasses or hearing aids</li>
        <li>List of current medications</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    
    <!-- Electronics Policy -->
    <div class="faq-section">
      <h2>Can my child have their phone or other electronics?</h2>
      <p>Children may keep their phones with them to contact parents if needed, but they will not be allowed to use them for games or other purposes except during scheduled breaks.</p>
      <p>We recommend leaving other electronics (tablets, gaming devices) at home to minimize distractions.</p>
    </div>
    
    <!-- Medications -->
    <div class="faq-section">
      <h2>Should my child take their regular medications on testing day?</h2>
      <p>Yes, your child should take all prescribed medications as usual, especially medications for conditions like ADHD. This helps us see how your child functions under their typical conditions.</p>
      <p>Please bring a list of all current medications, including dosages and schedules.</p>
    </div>
    
    <!-- Follow-up -->
    <div class="faq-section">
      <h2>What happens after testing is complete?</h2>
      <p>We will schedule a follow-up appointment (typically 2-3 weeks after testing) to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Review test results and our findings</li>
        <li>Discuss diagnoses (if applicable)</li>
        <li>Provide specific recommendations for home and school</li>
        <li>Answer all of your questions</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You will receive a comprehensive written report that documents the test results, interpretations, and recommendations.</p>
    </div>
